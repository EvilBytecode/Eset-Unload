# Eset-Unload üíâ

This project is a C++ application designed to help unload or manually load and unload the `ebehmoni.dll` module, a part of the ESET security software. It uses Visual Studio 143 toolset (v143) and ISO C++14.

---

## üìú Project Overview

The main goal of this tool is to:
- Enumerate and find the `ebehmoni.dll` module loaded in the current process.
- If found, unload it.
- If not found, load it manually from a specific path and then unload it.

This tool works by using Windows API calls to manage DLLs within the process.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. **Running the Application:**
    - Compile the application.
    - When you run it, the following will happen:
      - The current process ID is displayed.
      - The tool attempts to find and unload the `ebehmoni.dll`.
      - If it is not found, it tries to load the DLL from `C:\Program Files\ESET\ESET Security\` and then unloads it.

2. **Example Output**:
    ```
    [before start] press any key to begin module inspection...
    Press any key to continue . . .
    enumerating loaded modules in process 9100
    old base address of ebehmoni.dll: 0x7ffcfc570000
    found ebehmoni.dll at: C:\Program Files\ESET\ESET Security\ebehmoni.dll
    successfully unloaded module.
    attempting to unload ebehmoni.dll...
